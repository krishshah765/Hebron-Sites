Tab Masking Chrome Extension for Students
I used HTML, CSS, and JS to create an interactive Tab Masker! It includes a stopwatch on the top left, a todo list that is collapsable on the bottom left,
the active time and date in the center, and a "goal" at the bottom center portion of the screen. The todo list and "goal" sections use localStorage to 
maintain the values across new tabs being opened.
